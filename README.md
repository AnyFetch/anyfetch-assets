anyfetch-snippet-style
======================

Introduction
------------

Snippet style is made to help you use default anyfetch snippet & full mustache templates by styling them.

Snippet style tries to be not intrusive and respactful toward your current styles. Those styles will only apply on template elements (with the class namespace `anyfetch-`). They are also made of relative measures and font agnostic.

Usage
-----

Just run in your terminal:

```shell
bower install --save anyfetch-snippet-style
```

and in your HTML:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" src="bower_components/anyfetch-snippet-style/dist/index.css" />
```

Build
-----

If you want to build this repository:

```
npm install
bower install
gulp
```
